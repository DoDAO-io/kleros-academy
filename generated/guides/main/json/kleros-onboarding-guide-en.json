As a decentralized organization, it operates via a community governance structure where members of the community vote for decisions that will be made in the organization. \n\nThe governance token for Kleros is PNK which can also be staked and used to vote on proposals. A number of products that utilize Kleros Court have been developed by the Kleros team, and they include:\n\n* [Dispute Resolver](https://resolve.kleros.io)\n* [Escrow](https://escrow.kleros.io)\n* [Proof of Humanity](https://www.proofofhumanity.id/)\n* [Linguo](https://linguo.kleros.io/)\n* [Curate](https://curate.kleros.io/)\n* [Tokens](https://tokens.kleros.io/)",

The more PNK a user stakes, the higher the chance that they will be drawn as a juror in the selected court. Users who vote coherently will receive coherence rewards at the end of a dispute.\n* **Voting Rights**: PNK is used for all [governance decisions](https://kleros.gitbook.io/docs/governance) taken on the Kleros platform.
