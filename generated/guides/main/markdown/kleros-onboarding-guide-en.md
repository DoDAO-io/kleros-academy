Kleros is an open-source online dispute resolution protocol that uses blockchain and crowdsourcing to fairly adjudicate disputes.

It is the mission of Kleros to develop software enabling access to justice and individual freedom. As a decentralized organization, it operates via a community governance structure where members of the community vote for decisions that will be made in the organization. 

The governance token for Kleros is PNK which can also be staked and used to vote on proposals. A number of products that utilize Kleros Court have been developed by the Kleros team, and they include:

* [Dispute Resolver](https://resolve.kleros.io)
* [Escrow](https://escrow.kleros.io)
* [Proof of Humanity](https://www.proofofhumanity.id/)
* [Linguo](https://linguo.kleros.io/)
* [Curate](https://curate.kleros.io/)
* [Tokens](https://tokens.kleros.io/)

## PNK Token

The Pinakion (ticker: PNK) is the native token of Kleros, and is used both for participation in dispute resolution (e.g. staking in a Kleros court to stand a chance to be drawn as a juror) and in governance (i.e. voting rights for new proposals, or changes to the Kleros courts).
* **Staking and coherence rewards**: Users must stake PNK in order to be able to become [jurors in disputes](https://kleros.gitbook.io/docs/products/court/kleros-juror-tutorial). The more PNK a user stakes, the higher the chance that they will be drawn as a juror in the selected court. Users who vote coherently will receive coherence rewards at the end of a dispute.
* **Voting Rights**: PNK is used for all [governance decisions](https://kleros.gitbook.io/docs/governance) taken on the Kleros platform. We already use this mechanism to govern changes to our token curated lists and courts.

## Why Kleros Court works

Kleros Court leverages the judgment of a [decentralized and randomly-selected jury](https://blog.kleros.io/is-kleros-a-fair-dispute-resolution-system/) to resolve disputes in a trustless, yet fair and secure manner. This is made possible by several important choices in the design of the Court, making us the only [credibly neutral](https://kleros.gitbook.io/docs/products/court/kleros-and-credible-neutrality) dispute resolution system on Web3:
- Usage of **sortition**(aka random drawing of lots) for jury selection makes collusion extremely difficult.
- An **appeal system** makes random voting unfeasible and mitigates so-called [p+epsilon attacks](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/01/28/p-epsilon-attack/)
- The **purpose-specificity** of Kleros avoids the problem of community voting fatigue when dispute resolution is done using a DAO's internal governance processes.
- The **independence** of Kleros from other DAOs allows for disputes to be resolved in a neutral and impartial manner.

On top of that, the expertise and experience in dispute resolution of the Kleros community is unmatched in the Web3 space, and they continuously provide feedback to [Coopérative Kleros](https://kleros.io/coop/) (aka the core Kleros team) to improve the technology, parameters and policies of our courts.

## Use cases

Dispute resolution is one of the last remaining bastions of centralization in Web3, and Kleros is leading the charge to change that.

Here are some examples of Kleros being used:
* **(DeFi) insurance claim disputes** (see our partnership with [Unslashed Finance](https://blog.kleros.io/welcome-to-decentralized-insurance-kleros-x-unslashed-finance/))
* **Curation** (see Kleros token curated registries of [address tags](https://blog.kleros.io/the-kleros-decentralized-tag-registry-a-proof-of-concept-for-securing-web3/) and [tokens](https://blog.kleros.io/tokens-by-kleros-securing-uniswap-with-decentralized-lists/))
* **Identity verification** (see [Proof of Humanity](https://www.proofofhumanity.id/)) 
* **Securing oracle result resolutions** (see the [documentation](https://kleros.gitbook.io/docs/integrations/types-of-integrations/how-to-use-reality.eth-+-kleros-as-an-oracle) and the [Kleros+Gnosis’s partnership](https://blog.kleros.io/kleros-x-safesnap/))
* **Real-world arbitration** (see this example [from Mexico](https://blog.kleros.io/how-to-enforce-blockchain-dispute-resolution-in-court-the-kleros-case-in-mexico/))
