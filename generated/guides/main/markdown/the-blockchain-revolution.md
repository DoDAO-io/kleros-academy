## 1. The Blockchain Revolution


## Watch the lesson video

In this lesson, you will have a short introduction to the course and you will learn the key concepts of the blockchain revolution: why Web3 is a new iteration of the Internet and how it is different from Web2, the Internet controlled by the big tech companies of Silicon Valley. 

Watch this short recording of this first lesson by Kleros's CEO, Federico Ast before moving to the subsequent pages to test your knowledge!

## Quiz - The Blockchain Revolution

Let's test your understanding of how the Blockchain Revolution came about, and how Web3 protocols and applications contrast with their Web2 counterparts.
<hr>



##### Which event precipitated the rise of Bitcoin and the Blockchain Revolution?  
     
- [ ]  The 2000 dot-com crash.
- [x]  The 2008 Global Financial Crisis (aka Great Recession).
- [ ]  The 1929 stock market crash at the start of the Great Depression.





##### Why are Web2 platforms referred to as 'siren servers' by Jaron Lanier in his book 'Who Owns the Future'?  
     
- [ ]  They are great for sourcing great music.
- [x]  They draw us in with free services but take advantage of our personal data and intercepts our transactions.
- [ ]  They sound off alarms when malicious activities happen on their networks.

## Quiz - the Protocol Sink Thesis

The Protocol Sink Thesis is a great framework to understand the long-term viability of Web3 projects. Let's test our understanding of this concept!
<hr>



##### Which of the following describes the Protocol Sink Thesis for crypto-systems proposed by Ryan Sean Adam? Select all that are correct.  
     
- [x]  Protocols become more 'dense' as they are built on by other protocol/projects, and will tend to settle towards the bottom of the Protocol Sink.
- [x]  The more trustless, permissionless and credibly neutral a protocol is the further it can scale to become a global platform.
- [ ]  The thesis predicts that Web3 protocols will never reach the scale of their Web2 counterparts.
- [x]  The resting place of a protocol in the Protocol Sink is determined by its utility and surface area for attack.





##### Which of the following is the correct definition of Protocol Density?  
     
- [ ]  Utility / (Attack Surface)^2
- [x]  Utility / Attack Surface
- [ ]  Utility x Attack Surface

## Quiz - Building on Web3

Now, for the final quiz, let's test your knowledge on how and why to build in Web3!
<hr>



##### What are some benefits of building on Web3 solutions instead of their Web2 counterparts?  
     
- [x]  There is less supplier risk, as services built in a decentralized manner are uncensorable and more transparent.
- [ ]  The response time of decentralized API services are definitely better than Web2 alternatives.
- [x]  The cost and business models of the suppliers are more attuned towards the interests of the customers, and are less likely to tend towards rent-seeking behaviour as they scale.





##### What is a credibly neutral protocol?  
     
- [ ]  A protocol is credibly neutral if it is not created by a single centralized entity.
- [ ]  Anything can be considered credibly neutral if it does not extract rent and payments from its users.
- [x]  A credible neutral protocol is built on rules that doesn't arbitrarily benefit some group of users over others.
