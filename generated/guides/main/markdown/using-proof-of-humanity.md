[Proof of Humanity](https://blog.kleros.io/proof-of-humanity-an-explainer/), a Sybil-resistant (=duplicate and bot-proof) registry of humans.

Proof of Humanity (PoH) is a social identity verification system for humans on Ethereum. PoH combines webs of trust, reverse Turing tests, and dispute resolution to create a Sybil-proof list of humans. It can be used in a variety of existing and new applications that need identity solutions. Each user will need to prove they are real humans and not duplicate/fake/bot accounts. 

Registered humans will accrue 1 [UBI Token](https://blog.kleros.io/introducing-ubi-universal-basic-income-for-humans/) every hour that will get streamed directly to their wallet address. The UBI Token is a universal income currency which is accrued by all profiles successfully registered in the Proof of Humanity registry.

## Use Cases

[Proof of Humanity](https://proofofhumanity.id/) is a system combining social verification with video submission to create a Sybil-proof list of humans.

Building this type of advanced identity registry is not an end in itself. It is a point-of-entry to a myriad of new use cases that require Sybil-resistance (duplicate resistance) and can also be plugged into a variety of existing and new applications in need for such identity systems.

There are lots of amazing use cases and reasons to be on the PoH registry. Let's browse through a non-exhaustive list of use cases that benefit from PoH:

* Universal Basic Income (UBI)
* Innovative DAO frameworks
* Better Funding Mechanisms
* Universal Identifiers and Self-Sovereign Identities
* Certification and Reputation Systems
* Sybil-Resistant Airdrops (fair airdrop), Yield Farming and NFT Distribution
* Anti-Spam Tools
* Sidechains Secured by Proof-of-Humanity Consensus

## How to register?

Now that you have a basic understanding of what PoH is and its use cases, the next step is to learn how to prove you are human and get registered in the registry.

1. First, head on over to [app.proofofhumanity.id](https://app.proofofhumanity.id/) and you’ll be greeted by a screen similar to the above.

2. Next, connect your Ethereum / Web3 wallet.

3. Then click on "Submit profile" in the top banner.

4. After that, you will be asked to fill out the information required to submit a profile. Just fill out all the necessary information and read the [Registry Policy](https://ipfs.kleros.io/ipfs/QmXDiiBAizCPoLqHvcfTzuMT7uvFEe1j3s4TgoWWd4k5np/proof-of-humanity-registry-policy-v1.3.pdf).

5. Once you’re done, click submit, pay the deposit, and find a voucher.

Note: You will need to have a Submitter Deposit of 0.111 ETH (an amount of ETH you lock with the submission of your profile that will act as an incentive for potential challengers) which will be reimbursed once you’re successfully registered.

To make sure you get the registration right and avoid getting challenged, make sure to read this [PoH tutorial](https://kleros.gitbook.io/docs/products/proof-of-humanity/proof-of-humanity-tutorial).

For an example of how to do it right, check out [Vitalik Buterin’s](https://app.proofofhumanity.id/profile/0x1db3439a222c519ab44bb1144fc28167b4fa6ee6) profile on Proof of Humanity.

## Curate the registry

If you want to help to maintain the PoH registry and earn money by spotting fake, bot, and incorrect profiles, you will need to learn how to challenge these types of profiles when they are in "Pending Registration" status for 3.5 days.

As mentioned previously, users registering on PoH registry will need to have a Submitter Deposit which will serve as an incentive for challengers if a submission is proven to be incorrect, fake, duplicate or doesn’t meet the requirements set in the [Registry Policy](https://ipfs.kleros.io/ipfs/QmXDiiBAizCPoLqHvcfTzuMT7uvFEe1j3s4TgoWWd4k5np/proof-of-humanity-registry-policy-v1.3.pdf).

**Note:** You can only earn money by successfully challenging a profile in the “Pending Registration” phase. And as a challenger, you will also need to put up a Challenger Deposit which will act as a deterrent to prevent people from challenging profiles for no valid reason. 
* If your challenge of the profile is successful, you get your challenger deposit back and earn the Submitter Deposit (minus arbitration fees). 
* If you have challenged a valid profile, you will lose this deposit.

To learn more how to properly challenge a submission, check this [tutorial](https://kleros.gitbook.io/docs/products/proof-of-humanity/proof-humanity-tutorial-remove-and-challenge).

## Let’s onboard more humans

PoH DAO is looking forward to onboarding more humans into its growing community and distributing Universal Basic Income to as many people as it can. With this short guide, we will guide you on how to onboard more people in the PoH registry, including your family, friends and colleagues!

The first step is to share this PoH onboarding guide to anyone interested in joining the community. Anyone who finishes this guide will be eligible to claim a ‘Human Badge’ (NFT) on Project Galaxy.

Make sure to share this [PoH tutorial](https://kleros.gitbook.io/docs/products/proof-of-humanity) and have them read and understand the [Registry Policy](https://ipfs.kleros.io/ipfs/QmXDiiBAizCPoLqHvcfTzuMT7uvFEe1j3s4TgoWWd4k5np/proof-of-humanity-registry-policy-v1.3.pdf). If you have questions or need help in understanding the policy and the registration tutorials, you can ask for help in the community.

If users can’t afford to pay the Submitter Deposit, they can also join using crowdfunding. "**Crowdfund**" means you want to submit your profile without paying or only partially paying for the deposit. To be eligible for crowdfunding, make sure to finish this guide to claim the badge and join the PoH community (links will be provided in the next section of this guide).
