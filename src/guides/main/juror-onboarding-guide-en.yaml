      As you might already have learnt in our [community onboarding
      guide](https://kleros.dodao.io/onboarding/guide/view/60f7555c-30aa-48be-8dac-915b3cbea53b/4),
      Kleros is a decentralized dispute resolution service that relies on a jury
      to perform arbitration on all kinds of disputes in a trustless and
      decentralized manner.


      While jury systems exist in real-world jurisdictions like the United
      States, Canada and Ireland, **[Kleros](https://kleros.io)** is the first
      and only functioning jury-based dispute resolution system in Web3. It has
      several features that makes it uniquely effective and suitable for truly
      decentralized applications:

      * **Random selection** - jurors are randomly drawn using a provably random
      number generator, minimizing collusion between disputants and jurors.

      * **Juror anonymity** - jurors are free to conceal their real identities
      behind their on-chain addresses, preventing blackmail and collusion.

      * **Governance by economic incentives** - coherent voters in a case are
      rewarded economically, while incoherent voters have their stakes 'slashed'
      (partially taken away), creating an incentive for jurors to vote
      carefully.

      * **Self-selection of jurors** - access to the jury is permissionless, and
      the penalties of voting incoherently deter jurors from self-selecting
      themselves into courts which they lack the knowledge to arbitrate on.

      * **Appeal system** - The ability for anyone on the internet to appeal a
      case and challenge the judgment of the jury in a case drastically
      increases the security of the court against random voting, bribes and
      collusion.

      Taking part as a juror is easy - simply buy some **Pinakion/PNK** tokens,
      go to the [Kleros Court interface](https://court.kleros.io) and stake in
      the court that you feel most comfortable with contributing as a juror.

      steps to becoming a juror")


      Here are the links to bring you directly to where you need to be:


      1. Download a wallet (we recommend [Metamask](https://metamask.io/))

      2. Buy some Pinakion/PNK tokens (see list of decentralised and centralised
      exchanges [here](https://kleros.gitbook.io/docs/pnk-token))

      3. The [Court interface ](https://court.kleros.io/) (available on the
      Ethereum and Gnosis chain)

      All disputes initiated in Kleros go through these 5 stages:


      1. **Evidence** - Evidence can be submitted. This is also when drawing of
      jurors takes place.

      2. **Commit** - Jurors commit a hashed vote. This is skipped for courts
      without hidden votes. 

      3. **Vote** - Jurors reveal/cast their vote depending on whether the court
      has hidden votes or not. 

      4. **Appeal** -  The dispute can be appealed. 

      5. **Execution** - Tokens are redistributed and the ruling is executed.


      The overall flow is visualized in this diagram:

      The most important document present in every dispute is the **primary
      document**, which is a (PDF) file that describes the terms and conditions
      of the agreement that precedes the dispute, and lays out the rules for its
      resolution. Its role is similar to that of a piece of law or contract used
      for resolving real-world disputes, and forms the basis for jurors to
      decide what is the right ruling.


      In the diagram below, you can see a link to the primary document at the
      bottom of the screen in the Kleros Court interface: 

      ![Screenshot showing the primary document displayed at the bottom of the

      Evidences are documents uploaded in support of a particular outcome to a
      case. These can be anything from plain text, images to extensive (PDF)
      documents with in-depth analysis and argumentation.


      In the Kleros evidence standard (aka
      [ERC-1497](https://kleros.gitbook.io/docs/developer/erc-1497-evidence-standard)
      for the technically inclined), evidences are managed by the '*Arbitrable*'
      application (see the [ERC-792 Arbitration
      standard](https://kleros.gitbook.io/docs/developer/erc-792-arbitration-standard)),
      which is the application responsible for creating the dispute in Kleros
      Court and enforcing the ruling that comes back from it. They are then
      displayed in Kleros Court, and meant to be interpreted by the jurors using
      the Primary Document as backdrop.


      ![Relationship between Arbitrables and
      Arbitrators](https://3482524208-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-LPbPWuMtwBOvW0iuxyw%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-8d377e7918f3509618161378338a8cfeacfcf2b7%2Faa1%20(2).jpg?alt=media)


      **Provenance of evidences**


      It is important to note that there can be people outside of the disputants
      and the jury that would like to submit evidences or arguments (e.g.
      experts, impassioned community members, people with access to special
      information/knowledge). Therefore, most Arbitrable applications actually
      allow anyone on the internet to submit evidences as long as they are
      willing to expend gas to upload the evidence. 


      While each piece of evidence should be reviewed on its own merits, it can
      be insightful to know what the possible sources of evidences are in a
      case, and which categories of evidence (submitters) are or are not
      represented.

      In the Kleros system, a vote is **coherent** if it coincides with the
      majority choice, and is rewarded with a coherence reward at the conclusion
      of a case. On the other hand, incoherent votes will lead to the voter's
      stake getting slashed and redistributed to the coherent voters. It is also
      important to know that you must vote if you are drawn; otherwise you get
      slashed by default. 


      Coherence is only determined at the end of an entire dispute. If a vote
      was coherent only in the first round of a dispute, the voter could still
      be slashed at the end of a dispute if the final round of appeals led to a
      different ruling.


      **Refusing to arbitrate**


      There is always the option to choose to '**Refuse to arbitrate**' in any
      dispute on Kleros Court. 

      This option is reserved for situations where it is not reasonable for the
      jury to rule, which includes but are not limited to the following:

      * The case involves a topic that is inconsistent with the Court's policy
      (e.g. asking to rule on topics involving assassination markets, porn)

      * The jury is unable to access or verify the information presented in the
      case to make an informed vote.

      * The case was wrongly assigned to the court in question (e.g. a
      translation dispute case being brought to a technical blockchain court)


      Voting to 'Refuse to arbitrate' is considered as valid a choice as any
      other options presented to the jurors. You will therefore not be slashed
      for inactivity, and will be given coherence rewards if the majority
      chooses to 'Refuse to arbitrate' too, and slashed if you are in the
      minority.

      As shown in the diagrams in the section about the processes in Kleros
      Court, every round of voting is followed by an appeal stage. When a case
      is in appeal, anyone can appeal the case by placing the deposit, which
      will escalate the case into another round of arbitration with a larger and
      different set of jurors.


      The opportunity to appeal is especially interesting for jurors whose
      choice ended up being the minority choice of a round; if you believe you
      are truly right, you can appeal the case and upload new evidences and
      arguments to convince the next round of jurors. This gives you a chance to
      vindicate yourself and stand a chance to win a higher reward (e.g.
      coherence reward plus the deposit & stakes of those who supported the
      opposing side).
